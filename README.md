Task description:

Please create 2 models with at least the following attributes:

* Stock (name: string - must be unique)
* Bearer (name: string - must be unique)(can own many stocks)

Please create some JSON API endpoints:
* Create a stock with a referenced bearer
* Update a stock
* * The bearer cannot be updated with this endpoint. If you need to change it, a new object needs to be created
* * If Bearer exists already, it must be re-used and connected to the stock
* List all stocks with information their Bearer
* Soft-delete a stock so it doesn't appear on the API

Error responses should be detailed enough to see what exactly is missing or wrong.
